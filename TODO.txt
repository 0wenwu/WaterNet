MVC:
Program that can do two things:
- extract water bitmap from geotiff
- run CNN on the geotiff and water bitmap

Nice to haves:
- CLI
- choosing between different satellite providers
- extensive documentation
- several different models
- automatic evaluation of models
- visualisation of results

Functions:
- read_geotiff
- lat_lon_to_pixel
- get_bounds (from geotiff)
- extract_water (from bounds) (needs cache)
- create_bitmap_for_geotiff
- create_tiles_from_geotiff
