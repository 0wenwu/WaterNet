MVC:
Program that can do two things:
- extract water bitmap from GeoTIFF
- run CNN on the GeoTIFF and water bitmap

Nice to haves:
- CLI (one command for creating training data and one for training)
- choosing between different satellite providers
- extensive documentation
- several different models
- automatic evaluation of models
- visualization of results
- Docker

Desired behavior:
Specify several GeoTIFF images with corresponding shapefiles
(=> Specify if using cache)
(=> Specify tile_size)
=> specify training model
=> output results in forms of GeoTIFF and confusion matrix

File names:
- Shapefile with transformed coordinates: {satellite_img_name}_water_polygons.npy
- Bitmap as GeoTIFF: {satellite_img_name}_water.tif
- Bitmap as numpy: {satellite_img_name}_water.npy
- Tiled satellite image and bitmap: {satellite_img_name}_{tile_size}_tiles.pickle
    - Store as {"features": features, "labels": labels, "tile_size": tile_size}
- TODO: File names for models
